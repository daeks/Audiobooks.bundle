# Audiobooks (Audible) metadata agent

Metadata agent for Audiobooks stored in a music library. **Now available in the Unsupported App Store!**

This agent scrapes from Audible.com. It uses the Album Artist as the books Author and uses the Album Title as the Book Title. All audio files will need to be tagged correctly in order for this thing to do it's job. You can manually search for each book if you don't have them tagged ahead of time.

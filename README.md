# Forked Audiobooks (Audible) metadata agent

Metadata agent for Audiobooks stored in a music library.

This agent scrapes from Audible.com. It uses the Album Artist as the series name and uses the Album Title as the Book Title. All audio files will need to be tagged correctly in order for this thing to do it's job. You can manually search for each book if you don't have them tagged ahead of time.
